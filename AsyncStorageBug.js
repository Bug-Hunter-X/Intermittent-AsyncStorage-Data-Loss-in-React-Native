This React Native bug occurs when using AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data.  The issue is that when the app is closed and reopened, the data previously stored using AsyncStorage is not available. This often manifests as undefined or null values when attempting to retrieve stored items.  The issue is intermittent and does not always reproduce consistently.
