# React Native AsyncStorage Data Loss Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where data stored using AsyncStorage in React Native is intermittently lost when the application is closed and reopened. The issue is not consistent and may not reproduce every time.

## Bug Description

The primary problem is the unpredictable loss of data stored in AsyncStorage. The data stored using AsyncStorage sometimes remains intact after the app is closed and reopened but, other times it is completely inaccessible, returning null or undefined.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the app using a React Native development environment.
3. Store some data using AsyncStorage.
4. Close and reopen the application.
5. Attempt to retrieve the stored data.  Observe that the data may be missing.

## Solution

The solution often involves using a more robust storage method or implementing proper error handling and data persistence techniques. This repository includes a solution file (`AsyncStorageBugSolution.js`) to solve this bug. The solution uses a more reliable storage method which enhances the persistent storage of data.
